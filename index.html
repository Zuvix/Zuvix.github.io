<h3> What do I do?</h3>
<div>The two fields that bring me the most interest in the world of information technologies are Data science, especially artificial intelligence and game development. Data science is closely related to my studies in Information security at FIIT STU. I work as a member of research group called POWER, where we explore the possibilities of using behavioral biometrics to identify or categorize users. One of my best projects allowed me to estimate the age of people playing fruit ninja.</div>
</br>
<h3>Gamedev</h3>
<div>On the other hand, game development brings me the most joy and takes part mostly in my free time. Unlike Data science where you search for the best solution or algorithm, in the gamedev the best solution is the one that brings us the most fun. This hobby quickly developed into a passion and Hemisfera also provided me with a chance to share it as a lector of programming in Unity for children.</div>
</br>
<h3> My Goal</h3>
<div>One of my goals is to combine these two fields in a niche indie game where I get to use all of my ideas and share them with fellow programmers and gamers. Hopefully my future job opportunities will lead me there!</div>
