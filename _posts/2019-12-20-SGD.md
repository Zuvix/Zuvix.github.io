Fables was the first team project we worked on in Unity. By “we” I mean 
the team of programmers, artists and game designers grouped together by 
[Summer Game Dev](https://summergamedev.sk/) competition. The theme was 
**History Rewritten** and Fables filled the theme literally. 

### About the team
The team consisted of five people selected by SGD staff based on results 
of personality tests. For this year our team was called 
“The second table from the door” and the members were:

The team atmosphere was great and everyone was friendly. 
It was especially good to work with Naty, 
her hard work inspired me to give it my 100%, 
you can check some of her work

Also huge thanks to [Grand Beats](https://grandbeats.com/) 
for all the audio assets.

### About the game
Mythology, conspiracies, slavic, greek and urban legends or 
the Percy Jackson concept of mythical beings in the modern world, 
are all the key ideas we wished to put into a game. 
My job as someone who has experience with game design was to come 
up with a way to mesh all the ideas into a single game concept. 
That’s when the idea behind the Fables was born. So what is Fables?

![Pitch](/assets/img/pitch.png)

In the world of Fables your role is to choose the result of events 
that took place ages ago starting from the creation of the planet Earth. 
Did humans evolve from apes, leave the paradise as a result of 
eating forbidden fruit, or are they some sort of an alien experiment? 
Everything is decided by you. 
But beware, all the decisions have their consequences and 
affect the future of your world. The world is described by 3 variables:
- **Environmental health**: describes the health of planet and it’s non-human inhabitants. 
- **Population**: represents the size of the human population.
- **Satisfaction**: is equal to ability of humans to fulfill their desires, whether they are morally correct or not. 

When selecting an outcome of an event, it’s usually a tradeoff between 
two or more variables. Reaching the zero value of any variable 
marks the end of your story. Balancing the variables is a strategy to 
write long stories, but not the best ones. To create the greatest story, you need to entertain as many categories of readers as possible. For example, 
staying true to historical facts while making decisions might attract the group of scientists or evading bloody outcomes and sexual content will make the book readable for families with children.

To spice up the story, hidden gems are present. I will try not to spoil them all, but if you remember the talk about Percy Jackson concept, you might get the idea. If an event with a mythological being such as Medusa is resolved without her ending up headless, she might come visit you again in the future. Whenever you help her become a part of the society or use her for the purposes of science is up to your fantasy.
If you still have no idea what the gameplay is like, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRciUtz-wGk) is an example video.

### Programming 
From a technical view, this project represented more of a UI application than a game. The main task was to generate, display and resolve text events depending on the game state. We stored these events as scriptable game objects so we could easily edit them in the Unity Editor. The control of the game was managed by three main Classes: 
- **UiControl** is responsible for all methods working with UI, such as writing the text of an event, displaying the options for an event, loading corresponding art for conclusion…
- **GameSystem** is responsible for the logic of the game. Here we control what events are coming next, check if the variables are breaking threshold values and collect the data to categorize the story.
- **InputManager** implemented methods used to communicate between UiControl and GameSystem based on the input of player.

When it comes to design patterns we used Singleton to make the three main Classes easily accessible. To improve the performance we avoided using Update methodes completely, instead we used Coroutines if needed.

### Conclusion 
The game was a successful winner of the **audience award**. We gained feedback from a lot of important people working in the gaming industry and were advised to continue working on the project after the competition. Unfortunately, most of the team members were not from Bratislava so we didn’t manage to meet and finish the game.
