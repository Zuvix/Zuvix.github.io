AnimArch is a school project with aim to improve the explanation of selected architecture patterns by introducing animation techniques in Class diagrams. For me it was the first opportunity to work in a real Agile team driven by Scrum methodology supervised by Ing. Ivan Polášek, PhD. My role in the team was Unity programmer. My job was to visualize the Class diagrams in Unity, allow users to interact with the diagram, create, save and play animations written in [OAL](https://xtuml.org/learn/action-language-tutorial/) language. We finished the first part of the project in june 2020. Now we are waiting for evaluation by students and working on science article to summarize our work for other researchers. 

## Quick showcase
For student project competition we(me and my girlfriend) made a quick video in Slovak language to demonstrate the basic idea behind the project.

## Abstract of demo article
Architecture describes software in a static way through structural
models. Afterwards, the dynamic behavior of components of
architecture is modeled using behavioral models. Execution (even
if simulated) of these models allows to review and improve the
structural models. The downside of this approach is the necessity
to create the behavioral models. Even in CASE systems, their
creation is potentially time-consuming, especially with larger
models. 

The AnimArch software aims to
assign behaviour to existing structural models in a very simple way.
AnimArch is implemented as add-in for Enterprise Architect,
allowing to work with user’s existing class diagrams. The diagrams
are displayed in 3D space using Unity engine. There, the user can
create execution scenarios helping him to verify his architecture
quickly, without having to create additional complicated behavioral
models. Creating a scenario only requires clicking on classes in the
class diagram. The scenario is described by code written in a
derived version of OAL language and can be made more
sophisticated by adding custom code. Read more [here](https://smallpdf.com/shared#st=46be8a38-627a-47d8-8f3a-e42a923d73ef&fn=tim19_archmages_demopaper.pdf&ct=1593863655079&tl=share-document&rf=link)
