My name is Bc. Samuel Kubala. I'm 23 years old and i live in Bratislava, Slovakia. I'am a student of Information Security at FIIT STU. Some of my hobbies are fantasy literature, frisbee, tennis, bass guitar and gaming.

### My skills
During the Bachelor study i learned to code by solving variety of problems like knapsack problem, finding optimal path with dijkstra algorithm or building my own tree structures. For most of the problems we used C, C++ and Java.
My bachelor thesis required me to learn Python, mainly scikit-learn, pandas and other libraries used for data science and visualisation. I felt comfortable with Python and used it to solve multiple classification and regression problems.

On the other hand Unity engine became my favourite off school programming software. I mostly worked on 2D games(personal preference) and lectored programming in Unity to kids.
When it comes to non-programming skills i enjoy creating cardboard games or working on my own sets of rules for existing ones. For example [here](https://cubecobra.com/cube/list/5edf553764abb70f9b2f0ffa) i created a Peasant Cube for one of my favourite games, Magic the gathering.
