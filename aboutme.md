My name is Samuel Kubala and I am a 23 year old Masters student of Information Security at FIIT STU in Bratislava, Slovakia. Some of my hobbies are fantasy literature, frisbee, tennis, bass guitar and gaming.

### My skills
During my Bachelor studies I learned to code by solving a variety of problems like the Knapsack problem, finding the optimal path with the Dijkstra algorithm and building my own tree structures. Most of these problems were solved using C, C++ and Java. My Bachelor thesis required me to learn Python, mainly scikit-learn, pandas and other libraries used for data science and visualisation. I felt comfortable with Python and used it to solve multiple classification and regression problems.

In addition, Unity engine became my favourite out of school programming software. I mostly worked on 2D games (personal preference) and gave Unity programming lectures to kids. When it comes to non-programming skills, I enjoy creating cardboard games or working on my own sets of rules for existing ones. 
For example, [here](https://cubecobra.com/cube/list/5edf553764abb70f9b2f0ffa) I created a Peasant Cube for one of my favourite games - Magic the gathering.

### My personality
